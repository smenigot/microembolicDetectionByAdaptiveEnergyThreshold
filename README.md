# Microembolic detection by an adaptive energy threshold

This program can detect microembolic signature in ultrasound Doppler signal using an adaptive energy threshold from the file main.m. It can analyze an ultrasound Doppler signal recorded in wave file in two passes. The first passes analyzes the statistics of the short-term energy to adjust the adaptive threshold. Then the second pass detects the microembolus when the short-term energy is higher than the adaptive threshold.
